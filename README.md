# Jenn-Portfolio

This is a portfolio of my past and present work.

## About

I present a portfolio of my graphic design work as well as my newly developed skill as a full stack web developer. I was able to update my site so that it was responsive, linked to my recent web development work, and my git hub page. 

Any feed back is appreciated.
